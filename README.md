### Deadlands NPC Generator
#### https://github.com/Maciexpol/DeadlandsNPCGenerator
NPC generator for role-playing game series called **Deadlands**. Built with QT, its aim is to simplify and speed up the process of creating non-playable characters, therefore allowing Game Masters to focus on lore creating aspect of the game. Built with my friend for university project.

### Totem Rush multiplayer infrastructure
Totem Rush is a game we at [AGH CoIn](https://www.skn.agh.edu.pl/kolo/agh-code-industry-coin/) are currently developing. Because it is multiplayer game it needs, well... multiplayer servers.
